# LazyColumn with Sticky Headers – Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates how to build a **scrollable contact list** in Jetpack Compose with **alphabetical groupings** and a **scroll-to-top button**.  
It uses Compose components like `LazyColumn`, `stickyHeader`, and `animateScrollToItem()`.

## Features
- **Alphabetical Grouping**  
  Contacts are automatically grouped by their first letter and sorted A→Z.
- **Sticky Headers**  
  The current letter stays pinned at the top while scrolling.
- **Dynamic Scroll-to-Top Button**  
  A `TOP` button appears in the **top-right corner** once you scroll past item 10.
- **Smooth Animated Scroll**  
  Clicking the button scrolls smoothly back to the top using `animateScrollToItem()`.
- **50+ Modern US Political Figures**  
  Sample data is included with recognizable names and positions.
